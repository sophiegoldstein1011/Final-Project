        <p> A common phrase that my mother says when we talk about the future and her growing old is, “whatever you do, just don’t put me in a nursing home.” I always wondered why she said such a thing with little to no hesitancy in her voice. It wasn’t until I got older that I realized that nursing homes don’t always operate the way they should, and that what goes on inside those walls isn’t always how they portray themselves to the public. 
 </p>

          <p>My great-grandmother lived out the last three years of her life inside the Jewish Home of Greater Rochester. At this point, I was about 13-14 years old and had just started to reach the point in life of realizing that the world wasn’t as sunshine and rainbows as I had been lead to believe by my parents, who just wanted to shield me from reality for as long as possible. 
 </p>
          I remember my first visit to the Jewish Home very well, as it completely changed my perspective of how nursing homes really operate in a lot of places. At least in this situation, to be extremely blunt, it was depressing- nothing short of it. Lights flickered, staff talked back, rooms weren’t cleaned often enough, and many times I found that my great-grandmother- at the ripe age of 98- was being simply neglected. </p>
          
          <p> Time passed, and subconsciously-and rather selfishly- I never really wanted to go visit my great grandmother. It’s not that I didn’t want to see her, it was that I couldn’t stand to see her living in such conditions. I was extremely let down and angry at the world for letting someone live in such a space and I’d ask myself- how is this possible and how are they getting away with it? </p>
          
          <p> As I grew up and read more news and met more people- some of which worked in nursing homes- I realized that this wasn’t always the situation within a nursing home, and that there are many things that have been done to combat the homes that do have significant issues like the Jewish Home did. Within the data set I found from ProPublica, I discovered a consistently updated database that held information on fines and discrepancies from nursing homes all over the country.  </p>
          
          <p> Nhya Gonzalez, a senior at SU, spends her school breaks working in a nursing home in her hometown of Amherst, NY. Gonzalez explained to me her disappointment from many people’s views of nursing homes and their staff. “I think that a lot of people hear one story and just get carried away with the idea that all nursing home staff treat residents like crap.” While there are many negative stories put out into the world on mistreatment, Gonzalez says we need to pay just as much attention to the feel-good, positive stories as well. </p>
          
          <p> Gonzalez stated that the only real times her place of work was written up was during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not because they were blatantly trying to ignore the rules, but a lot of the residents genuinely couldn’t remember to keep a mask on, social distance, and follow the other regulations of the pandemic. However, there were some staff who were less inclined to want to follow all the regulations- so to say. 


 </p>
          
          <p> To follow up on that, the issue of some nursing home staff is a serious problem amongst homes across the country, and NY specifically. With the older age of a lot of these residents comes forgetfulness, disabilities, etc. Because of this, staff are sometimes more impatient with residents and feel as though they have a certain power over them which can lead to negative results.  </p> 
         <iframe title="NY Nursing Homes and Their Scope Severity" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-7E5vH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7E5vH/2/" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="450" height="346" data-external="1"></iframe>
          <p> The table (above) holds the information of all NYS nursing homes with the scope severity of each time they’ve been hit with a violation. If there is a specific home or town you are looking for, you can search it up in the search bar at the top of the table. . </p>
          
          <p> Joe Martino has spent his first year post-grad working full time in a nursing home in a town just outside of Poughkeepsie, NY. His main focus while working here has been in the physical therapy wing of the home, which is a unique feature of the home. Martino said that his favorite part of his work is how much he gets to interact with patients. </p>
          
          
          <iframe title="Understanding Deficiencies" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-SCKHr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SCKHr/1/" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="500" height="346" data-external="1"></iframe>
            <p> Martino commented on the mistreatment of residents in some homes, and said that its an issue that he believes is on the smaller side, but extremely significant. “Being able to interact with so many of these people who are so kind and have incredible stories, it makes it hard for me to think that they could ever be subjected to such mistreatment.”  </p>
              <p> 
As previously stated, the fines that some of these homes have been subjected to are very serious- including one that is considered to be a “level J” which is one of the most serious fine levels. This fine was for a “failure to provide basic life support including CPR.”
 </p>
          <p> According to the data table above, the majority of fines and violations are deemed as a level 2 severity, while less than 4% of them are considered to be of the highest severity level (level 4). Of the level 4 fines, the majority of them are considered to be isolated, which means that very few people were affected by them.</p>
          
          <p> This goes to show that while serious violations do occur, a majority of nursing homes in NYS and across the US take extremely good care of their residents/patients. After talking to both Martino and Gonzalez, it was made clear to me that sometimes fines are almost unavoidable as inspections are very “nit-picky” with what they consider to be a violation.  </p>
